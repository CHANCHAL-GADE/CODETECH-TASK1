### Objective

Develop a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application should:

 Accept two numerical inputs from the user.
 Provide an interface to select the desired operation.
 Display the result of the operation clearly.
 Handle errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
 Maintain a user-friendly interface for ease of use.
 This project aims to reinforce fundamental programming concepts and improve user interaction design skills.

### Key Activities:
- Define Requirements:Determine the operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Design User Interface:Sketch a layout for the calculator,design buttons for each operation and digits.
- Testing:Perform unit tests on arithmetic functions,test the user interface for usability and functionality
#### Technology Used:
 programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python), development tools (IDE, libraries).
